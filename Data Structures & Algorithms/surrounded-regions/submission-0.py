"""
UNDERSTAND: Capture any enclosed region, which is O's, and turn it into X's in the graph
I: Matrix graph
O: Matrix graph
E: Empty board -> return empty

MATCH: BFS, to find O's and the X's the surround it

PLAN: Use BFS to find the O's, then use it to look at the shape. Once we get the shape, we can see if it is completely enclosed (vertical and horizontally) with BFS so we can change it into X's.
